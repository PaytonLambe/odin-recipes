    <h2>Desctiption</h2>
    <p>This roast is extremely easy and is always a go-to when I catch the chuck on sale
        at the store. It involves few ingredients and can be made in a crock pot or dutch 
        oven. 
    </p>
    <p>Although not included in the recipe, my preference is eat the roast over mashed 
        potatoes with a side of roasted carrots and a dinner role. Yet another winter favorite.
    </p>
