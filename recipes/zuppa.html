    <h2>Desctiption</h2>
    <p>Zuppa Toscana is a favorite dish among my family. This hearty soup is traditionally
        full of vegetables such as kale, potatoes, and zucchini. It also inludes savory meats 
        such as italian sausage and bacon. 
    </p>
    <p>This delicious wintery recipe will be made paleo so there will be a few necessary 
        substitutes. I have also made some additional changes for my own preference. I like to 
        add one or two red bell peppers rather than the bacon to my soup.
