    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe originally came from a lasagna recipe. It has since been slightly modified
         and applied all sorts of Italian dished. It can be made vegetarian but I personally 
         enjoy it with an even mix of hot italian sausage and ground beef. 
    </p>
    <p>This meal can be enjoyed year round but I love the winter for meals like this. If 
        you have read any of my other recipes, you will already know that cold weather 
        cooking is one of my favorite things.
